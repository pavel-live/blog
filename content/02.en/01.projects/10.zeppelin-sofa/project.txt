content:

> Zeppelin is a soft lining sofa. The inspiration for this product was the aero forms and framework structures of the similarly-named dirigible, named after a German inventor Ferdinand Zeppelin.

It is a framework structure with its smooth lines and big radii on which you can arrange yourself for the rest. Notwithstanding the fact that, an image for this sofa's creation was a Rigid airship image, the soft lining and internal filler formation create a soft effect.
 
This sofa will definitely seamlessly fit a contemporary interior, creating its composition center.
