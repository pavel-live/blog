content:

> The approach to the Mono sink design creation included the kitchen sinks functional characteristics expressing, with a minimal amount of lines and bevels, for which it would be easy to care for and which at the same time would create an interesting and dynamic image for a contemporary kitchen.

On the sink's side there is an overflow, which, alongside with the outlet is designed in such a way, that it can manage a maximum water flow rate without any difficulties.

The sink is manufactured out of Cristadur, an innovational material, which creates the pleasant sensations with each touch and has better working characteristics, thanks to its unique composition.
