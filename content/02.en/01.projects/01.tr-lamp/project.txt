The restrained and memorable TR lamp will impart the supersonic dynamics to any type of interior.

> Its dome's shape is iconic and resembles a plane turbine image, a graceful and suspended object, which helps us to cope with the long distances and makes our dreams' realization closer.

The lamp's decorative fixture, created in a form of a cowl, serves as a light diffuser mounting and can be performed out of the different materials, for example, marble or wood, creating the interesting nuance combinations for any type of interior.
