content:

The starting point for the Ame mixer tap creation was a symbiosis of the technologies with the everyday objects with which a human interacts, even, if they were analogous before. 

Its organic form, made out of the genuine composite stone is pleasant both visually, and tactually, which brings the naturality into the water procedures process.

The water temperature and pressure adjustment interface is situated on the sensor panel handle.
