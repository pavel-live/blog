content:

A close view of a shark fin subconsciously causes a sensation of risk and the adrenaline discharge. Appearing in the ocean, it instantly scares away all the flesh around it. But our lamp scares away only the surrounding darkness. For what it is actually designed.

Created for the risk and adrenaline buzz fans, the Shark lamp will definitely become an effective lobby or entry hall decoration, an expressive decorative fixture in a park, garden or on a terrace, effectively illuminating the surrounding terrain.
